## Project Overview  
As a data analyst at Walmart, I led a comprehensive sales forecasting initiative designed to enhance predictive analytics across our retail operations. The project leveraged historical sales data from 45 stores, focusing on understanding and modeling complex sales dynamics.

---

## Business Challenges  
1. **Impact of Holiday Markdowns**:  
   Walmartâ€™s promotional markdowns tied to key holidays significantly affect sales. These weeks are weighted five times higher in evaluation metrics, making it critical to accurately model their effects.

2. **Limited Historical Data**:  
   The analysis of markdowns and their impact during holiday weeks is challenging due to incomplete or limited historical data.

3. **Seasonal Variability**:  
   Fluctuating sales during holiday seasons require effective trend analysis to anticipate changes in sales patterns and customer behavior.

## Project Objectives  
The primary objectives of this project are to:  
- Identify underperforming stores and provide recommendations for improvement.  
- Highlight high-performing product categories and explore underperforming ones for optimization.  
- Analyze customer behavior patterns, including purchase timing, payment methods, and seasonal preferences.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of holiday markdowns in boosting sales and their impact on department-wide performance.  
- Provide forecasting models for future sales predictions based on historical data.
